# Economic Analysis of Carbon Emissions in Pakistan

## Description
This repository contains Python code and data files for conducting an economic analysis of carbon dioxide emissions in Pakistan. Leveraging data from the World Development Indicators (WDI), the analysis explores the relationship between key economic factors and carbon emissions over a specific time period. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), linear regression analysis, and logarithmic transformation to investigate the impact of variables such as GDP, urbanization, trade volume, and inflation on carbon dioxide damage. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and researchers interested in sustainable development and environmental conservation in Pakistan.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insights into economic trends
- Linear regression analysis to examine the relationship between economic factors and carbon emissions
- Logarithmic transformation for capturing potential nonlinear relationships
- Visualization of economic variables and regression results
- Interpretation of regression coefficients and model performance metrics

## Credits
This project was developed by Zaafir Baig as part of my university assignment for my course Environmental Economics.
